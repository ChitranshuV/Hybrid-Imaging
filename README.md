# Hybrid-Imaging

This project was as a part of my EE6132 - Modern Computer Vision Course involving Hybrid Imaging and use of filtering operations for doing convolution from scratch.  Hybrid images is a concept that is mentioned in this paper - http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybridimage.htm. (SIGGRAPH 2006). The main concept is to convolve images into 2 sets - high pass image and the low pass image. Add thtem in weighted fashion will give us a hybrid image which will look different when you sub-sample the hybrid image. The low pass image looks much prominent when the resolution is decreased
